            <h2>Outdoor gardening can help your body fight disease</h2>
            <p>You're more like a plant than you may realize. Your body is capable of photosynthesis — the process where plants make their own food using sunlight.

              Your skin uses sunlight to make one of the nutrients you need: vitamin D. ResearchersTrusted Source estimate that a half hour in the sun can produce between 8,000 and 50,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D in your body, depending on how much your clothes cover and the color of your skin.</p>

            <h2>Gardening calms you after stressful events</h2>
            <p>Working in a garden can help you recuperate if you’ve experienced something stressful.

              In a 2011 study, researchers exposed study participants to a stressful activity. Then they asked half the group to spend time quietly reading and the other half to spend time gardening.

              When researchers tested the levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their bodies, they found that the gardening group had recovered from the stress better than the reading group. The gardening group also reported that their moods had returned to a positive state — while fewer of the readers had</p>

            <h2>Gardening can help protect your memory as you get older</h2>
            <p>Doctors have also known for some time that exercise improves cognitive functioning in the brain. There’s some debate about whether gardening on its own is enough to affect cognitive skills like memory. But new evidence shows that gardening activities may spur growth in your brain’s memory-related nerves.

              Researchers in Korea gave 20-minute gardening activities to people being treated for dementia in an inpatient facility. After the residents had raked and planted in vegetable gardens, researchers discovered increased amounts of some brain nerve growth factors associated with memory in both males and females.</p>

            <h2>1. Use All Surfaces Of Your Balcony</h2>
            <p>So much attention in gardening is focused downwards on digging, planting and weeding flower beds and lawns, but vertical gardens can make the most of a small space.

              There's a good chance your balcony has limited square footage, so take advantage of all the surface area you have available. Vertical space can be maximized, for example, with hanging planters that hook directly onto your railing. </p>

            <h2>2. Choose The Right Size Planters</h2>
            <p>When you plan a small garden, it's important to factor in the size of the planters, and resist them temptation to overcrowd the space, so you can give plants enough room to grow.

              'The container needs to be large enough to support the size plant(s) you will be growing in it,' says Jeanine Standard of Proven Winners, one of the leading plant brands in the U.S.  'The more plants you are adding to the container, the larger it needs to be in order to hold a good amount of soil that will provide the water the plant needs.'</p>

            <h2>3. Choose A Type Of Garden</h2>
            <p>Before you start planting, decide what type of garden you want to have, as well as the type that'll work for your outdoor space.

              A balcony that gets lots of light is perfect for annuals like poppies or petunias or a vegetable garden, while one that's mostly in the shade can be better suited to flowers like Sweet Alyssum or boxwood shrubs.

              When you're container gardening, it's also wise to separate annuals and perennials, that way come winter, you can move your perennial planters indoors. </p>

            <h2>4. Use A Plant Stand</h2>
            <p>A multi-tiered plant stand allows for plenty of pots without crowding the floor. Use all the same plant to make a cohesive statement, or vary your pots and planters for a cottage container garden feel. </p>

            <h2>5. Grow A Living Wall Vegetable Garden</h2>
            <p>When you think of a vegetable garden, you may think of a sprawling suburban yard or a large plot of farmland, but a balcony wall can offer a chance to incorporate a small vegetable garden into your limited outdoor space.

              'A vertical garden makes green space accessible to the masses and as attention continues to turn to where our food comes from, we’re not hugely surprised that people are now thinking about what more their living walls can offer them,' says Matt Lindsay, general manager at Growing Revolution. 'With a fixture against an external wall or on a balcony, those in flats and other urban homes can reap the physical, mental and environmental rewards that gardening for production provides.'</p>

            <p>Balcony gardens are the perfect place to enjoy a morning coffee or an afternoon tea, so why not set up a cozy spot to perch.

              This space mixes nature with surrounding structures, in a way that is very original. The style is undulating and looks like a beautiful picture. There’s structure, but there’s a wild harmony to it that fits with the overall design ethos. </p>

            <h2>7. Plant According To Sunlight</h2>
            <p>You need to consider how much sunlight your balcony gets. This may mean you have to position plants in certain places, and it will also help in deciding which plants to choose.

              If you get sunlight pretty much all day, choose varieties such as petunias or marigolds. If sun is hard to come by, primroses and foxgloves would be good options.</p>

              If you want to make a small garden look bigger, Isabelle advises: 'Lighter color flowers really open up a space, so put your lightest flowers at the furthest point so that your eyes are drawn outwards.' </p>
